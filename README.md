# react-starter :goat:

Hey, Orlando Devs! This will probably save you hours of setup time for starting a brand new shiny React project. Follow these steps and you'll be up and running in no time:

1. Open your terminal, and clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:OrlandoDevs/react-starter.git`
2. Install all the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the project: `npm start`
4. Go to `http://localhost:8080`
5. Start building something awesome!

This starter kit uses Webpack to bundle all of your JS dependencies, as well as process your CSS and HTML. Whenever you make a change in any project file, the bundle will _automatically_ be re-bundled. Pretty cool, huh?
